"""Example demonstrating multi-channel wait operations in sequences.

This example shows how to use wait with multiple channels to synchronize
operations across different quantum channels.

Note: Multi-channel wait is only allowed in sequences, not schedules.
In schedules, wait can only be applied to a single channel because
multi-channel wait would have complex semantics (equivalent to a subschedule
where all channels idle), which contradicts the sequence definition where
wait time is appended independently to each channel.
