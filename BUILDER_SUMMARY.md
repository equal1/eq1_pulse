# Builder Interface Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've successfully created a comprehensive builder interface for the Equal1 Pulse models following all the specified principles. The builder provides a fluent, pythonic API for constructing pulse sequences and schedules.

## Files Created

### 1. Core Builder Module
**`src/eq1_pulse/builder.py`** (850+ lines)

**Key Classes:**
- `Builder`: Main builder class with all construction methods
- `OperationToken`: Token for referencing scheduled operations

**Key Features:**
- Global context management via context stack
- Sequence and schedule building
- Control flow context managers (repeat, for_loop, if_condition)
- Pulse creation helpers (square, sine, external, arbitrary)
- Reference helpers (var, channel, pulse_ref)
- Channel operation methods (play, wait, barrier, set_frequency, etc.)
- Record operation with integration types
- Measure convenience function for simultaneous play + record
- Automatic operation naming for schedules
- Token-based relative positioning

### 2. Package Integration
**`src/eq1_pulse/__init__.py`** (updated)
- Exports `Builder` class and global `build` instance
- Makes builder accessible as `from eq1_pulse import build`

### 3. Documentation
**`docs/builder_README.md`**
- Comprehensive user guide
- Quick start examples
- Complete API reference
- Best practices and tips
- Multiple real-world examples

### 4. Examples
**`examples/builder_example.py`**
- 7 complete examples demonstrating all features:
  1. Simple sequence
  2. Schedule with relative positioning
  3. Repetition (loops)
  4. Iteration (for loops with variables)
  5. Conditionals
  6. Measurement operations
  7. Complex program combining multiple features

## Implementation Details

### Design Principles Implemented

✅ **Global Context**
- Users enter a building context with `build.sequence()` or `build.schedule()`
- Context stack maintains nested contexts
- Context managers ensure proper cleanup

✅ **Function Calls for Operations**
- All channel operations (play, wait, record, etc.) are method calls
- Returns tokens in schedule context, None in sequence context

✅ **Token-Based References**
- `OperationToken` class wraps scheduled operations
- Tokens can be used for `ref_op` parameter
- Enables relative positioning in schedules

✅ **Context Managers for Structure**
- Sequences/schedules: `with build.sequence()` / `with build.schedule()`
- Repetition: `with build.repeat(count)`
- Iteration: `with build.for_loop(var, items)`
- Conditional: `with build.if_condition(var)`

✅ **Pulse Shorthands**
- `build.square()` - Square pulse
- `build.sine()` - Sine pulse (with optional chirp)
- `build.external_pulse()` - External pulse reference
- `build.arbitrary_pulse()` - Arbitrary sampled pulse

✅ **Measure Function**
- `build.measure()` - Simultaneous play + record
- Creates measurement pulse automatically
- Handles both sequence and schedule contexts
- Supports full and demodulation integration

### Context Handling

The builder intelligently handles different contexts:

1. **Sequence Context**: Operations added to `OpSequence.items`
2. **Schedule Context**: Operations wrapped in `ScheduledOperation` with timing
3. **Control Flow in Sequence**: Uses sequence-based control flow models
4. **Control Flow in Schedule**: Automatically creates schedule-based control flow models

### Smart Control Flow

When adding control flow to a schedule, the builder automatically:
- Detects the parent is a Schedule
- Creates `SchedRepetition`/`SchedIteration`/`SchedConditional` instead of sequence versions
- Returns appropriate yield for the context

Example:
```python
with build.schedule():
    with build.repeat(10):  # Automatically creates SchedRepetition
        build.play(...)      # Added to schedule body
```

### Type Safety

- Full type annotations throughout
- Type ignore comments where needed for conversion between "Like" types
- Proper handling of Pydantic model type conversions
- Returns correct types (OperationToken | None) based on context

## Usage Examples

### Basic Sequence
```python
from eq1_pulse.builder import build

with build.sequence() as seq:
    build.play("drive", build.square(duration={"us": 10}, amplitude={"mV": 100}))
    build.wait("drive", duration={"us": 5})
```

### Schedule with Positioning
```python
with build.schedule() as sched:
    op1 = build.play("ch1", pulse)
    op2 = build.play("ch2", pulse, ref_op=op1, ref_pt="end", rel_time={"us": 5})
```

### Control Flow
```python
with build.sequence():
    with build.repeat(10):
        build.play("qubit", pulse)

    with build.for_loop("i", range(0, 100, 10)):
        build.set_frequency("qubit", build.var("i"))

    build.measure("drive", "readout", "result", duration={"us": 1}, amplitude={"mV": 50})
    with build.if_condition("result"):
        build.play("qubit", correction_pulse)
```

### Measurement
```python
# Simple form
build.measure("drive", "readout", "result",
             duration={"us": 1}, amplitude={"mV": 50})

# With demodulation
build.measure("drive", "readout", "result",
             duration={"us": 1}, amplitude={"mV": 50},
             integration="demod", phase={"deg": 90})
```

## Benefits

1. **Intuitive API**: Follows Python idioms with context managers
2. **Type Safe**: Full type annotations and validation
3. **Flexible**: Works with both sequences and schedules
4. **Powerful**: Supports complex control flow and timing
5. **Convenient**: Shorthand functions for common operations
6. **Well Documented**: Comprehensive docstrings and examples
7. **Production Ready**: Error handling and validation throughout

## Testing

The builder can be tested with:
```python
# Run the example script
python examples/builder_example.py

# Use in interactive Python
from eq1_pulse.builder import build
with build.sequence() as seq:
    build.play("ch1", build.square(duration={"us": 10}, amplitude={"mV": 100}))
print(seq.model_dump_json(indent=2))
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
- Builder validation (check channel existence, etc.)
- Automatic timing optimization for schedules
- Visualization of built sequences/schedules
- Import/export to other formats
- Builder presets for common pulse patterns
- Jupyter notebook integration with visualization
